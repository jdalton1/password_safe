# Overview

This is a password safe program written in Java. It creates and writes to a file, utilizes classes, and generates a random password with capital, lowercase, numbers, and special characers.

I have a peer that is constantly struggling to come up with passwords that are more secure and not just a simple word. He also doesn't like having to remember
all his passwords. This gave me the idea to make a my own version of a password safe, with the ability to customize the password length. I am focusing on increasing my 
Java skills to better prepare me for inernships and possible employment as a software developer.
